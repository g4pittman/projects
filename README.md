### [📘 Predicting Post-Volatility Stock Corrections Using Machine Learning](volatility-model/README.md)
Using U.S. equity, macroeconomic, and firm-level data, this project builds **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, and **Random Forest** models to predict how stocks behave after major volatility shocks.  
It features over **40 engineered variables**, including technical indicators, fundamentals, and yield curve spreads, with **SHAP-based interpretability** for feature insights.  
**Highlights:** Data integration across time horizons, GroupKFold cross-validation, and volatility event modeling for 1-, 5-, and 20-day return horizons.
